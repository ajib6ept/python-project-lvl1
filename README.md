***

This is the first project in the Python learning course [hexlet.io](https://ru.hexlet.io)

This package contains a few simple games:

* Check even `brain-even` - (_you need to determine the parity of a number in the range from 10 to 100, answer only "yes" or "no"_)
* Calculator `brain-calc` - (_you need to calculate the result of the expression (for example 15 + 8)_)
* Greatest common divisor `brain-gcd` - (_you need to find the greatest common divisor of given numbers (for example 14 7)_)
* Arithmetic progression `brain-progression` - (_you need to find what number is missing in the progression (for example 13 19 25 31 .. 43 49 55 61 67)_)
* Prime number `brain-prime` - (_you need to determine if this number is a prime number in the range from 10 to 100, answer only "yes" or "no"_)
